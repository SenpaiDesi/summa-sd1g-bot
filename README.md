# summa sd1g bot
Discord chat bot for the discord server of my college

## About
This project is made for fun after being asked to do so by my mentor.
The bot contains:
- Homework check for students
- Admins can add / delete homework
- Moderation such as Warn, Kick, Ban, Unban
- FAQ links Such as password reset, online learning method.
- User information Whois, Avatar
- Jokes (Dad joke, programming, dark humor, spooky)
- SD1G's time table

Note that there might be an adjustment later on that will allow the bot to see every time table of every class within the school's building.However for that we need the api key which is being discussed internally.
